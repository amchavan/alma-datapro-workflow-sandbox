Python 2 vs Python 3

Python2: unicode(<str>, "UTF-8")
Python3: str(<str>, "UTF-8)

Python2: getattr #Look at logs in SimpleEnvelope.py
Python3: inspect.getattr_static

Python2: All modules require __init__.py empty files.
Python3: Only required for resources module.

Python2: New classes explicitly by importing 'object'.
Python3: Importing nothing bears the same result.

Python2: Use of __name__ as __qualname__ doesn't exist. Luckily we don't use subclasses for messages (where it mattered) as it wouldn't work properly.
Python3: Use of __qualname__.
